            <h1>The Wayfare Engine</h1>
            <p>
                The Wayfare Engine is a method of drawing cards to create events
                (commonly called encounters in other systems) to interact with.
                The events provided here are basic and versatile, while
                remaining inspiring.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Wayfare Engine is intended to be used in roleplaying games
                that focus on exploration, discovery, or advancement. They can
                also be inserted into a system as a way of generating random
                encounters or used as a type of oracle in solo games.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Deck.</strong> Refers to a collection of cards. The
                rules will call for a deck to be assembled. When this happens
                the contents of the deck will be specified.
            </p>
            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>
                To determine the kind of event encountered, assemble a full deck
                of cards (excluding the jokers), and draw one. Consult the
                following table, reading from left to right.
            </p>

                tact to resolve some issue the outside faction faces.
