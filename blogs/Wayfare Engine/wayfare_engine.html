            <h1>The Wayfare Engine</h1>
            <p>
                The Wayfare Engine is a method of drawing cards to create events
                (commonly called encounters in other systems) to interact with.
                The events provided here are basic and versatile, while
                remaining inspiring.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Wayfare Engine is intended to be used in roleplaying games
                that focus on exploration, discovery, or advancement. They can
                also be inserted into a system as a way of generating random
                encounters or used in conjunction with an oracle in solo games.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <!-- <h3>Some Terms</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Deck.</strong> Refers to a collection of cards. The
                rules will call for a deck to be assembled. When this happens
                the contents of the deck will be specified.
            </p> -->
            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>
                To determine the kind of event encountered, simply draw a card
                from a deck (excluding the jokers) and consult the following
                table, reading from left to right. You can use a whole deck,
                arrange the cards face down in a grid to create a map for a
                dungeon or wilderness crawl, or some other creative way of
                drawing the cards that feels appropriate.

                Here are the brief descriptions of each event. They are left as
                guidelines for your own elaboration later. If you are so
                inclined, you can create your own or find supplementary tables or
                oracles to determine the details for the event. The Wayfare
                Engine is simply a template for exploration and discovery.
            </p>
            <h2>Advent</h2>
            <p>
                An <strong>Advent</strong> is some milestone of discovery. The
                group gains knowledge about some aspect of the world.
            </p>
            <h2>Calm</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>Calm</strong> is a period where very little happens
                outside the group. This is an opportunity for players and
                characters to roleplay between themselves.
            </p>
            <h2>Combat</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>Combat</strong> is some attack by an outside force.
                Enemies of the group seek to do them harm.
            </p>
            <h2>Counsel</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>Counsel</strong> is a roleplay interaction with a
                faction outside of the group, usually requiring diplomacy and
                tact to resolve some issue the outside faction faces.
            </p>
            <h2>Emergency</h2>
            <p>
                An <strong>Emergency</strong> is a sudden disaster that the
                group faces that will result in harm to the group.
