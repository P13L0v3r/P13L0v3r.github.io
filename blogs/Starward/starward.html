            <h1>Welcome</h1>

            <p>
                Starward is a collaborative worldbuilding roleplaying game.
                Players create the world that they play in as they play. The
                game begins with the players each creating a set of profiles:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Star System</li>
                <li>Planet</li>
                <li>Civilization</li>
                <li>Culture</li>
                <li>Race</li>
                <li>Person</li>
                <li>Antagonist</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These profiles create lore for the game universe that is only
                known by the player that writes them. As the game progresses,
                the lore in these profiles is revealed to the rest of the
                players and characters. Part of the game is connecting the
                profiles you create with the other players' profiles.
            </p>

            <p>
                Initially, the game only prompts the players to provide surface
                details in their profiles. Later, the game prompts the players
                to furthur develop their profiles. This doesn't mean that a
                particularly ambitious player can't develop their profiles on
                their own. After all, the profiles are theirs to write.
            </p>

            <p>
                Players may use whatever means at their disposal to create their
                profiles, but Starward provides worksheets that can be filled
                out in
                <em>Starward Field Manuals</em>. Each player gets their own
                <em>Starward Field Manual</em> that also includes a section for the
                character that they will be playing (see below).
            </p>

            <p>
                The profiles that a player creates are intended to be
                disconnected. Players should create each profile as if it was
                the only profile they created. As the game plays out, the player
                may discover that their profiles are connected to each other or
                other players' profiles.
            </p>

            <p>
                A player creates their character only after they've completed
                inital development of their profiles. A player's character will
                have its own profile in the player's
                <em>Manual</em>. A player is encouraged to develop their
                character as much as they'd like. As with other profiles,
                certain aspects of a player's character will be discovered as
                the game progresses.
            </p>
            <h1>The Game</h1>
            <p>
                Starward is a tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) intended for 3-5
                players, though the more players the richer the world. Players
                roleplay as characters in a space adventure. These Player
                Characters (also known as PCs) are all part of the crew of a
                starship. PCs encounter threats, make alliances, uncover
                treasure, and document the new and strange universe they
                discover. This is where Starward diverges from most other
                TTRPGs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Starward is GM-less, meaning that there is no single person that
                knows everything about the world or controls the enemies.
                Instead of personal character advancement, the characters' ship
                advances along multiple development trees. Instead of dice,
                Starward uses cards when it becomes necessary to determine a
                random outcome. Lastly, Starward is narrative-based, meaning
                that the game sacrifices hard and fast rules for a more
                classically heroic story experience. Combat in Starward is
                minimal; characters don't have inventories that the players have
                to manage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Starward is a game about finding your way in a vast universe.
                Players decide what story they want to tell. Instead of a strict
                map, characters travel narratively between points of interest.
                The players discover these points of interest as they play,
                creating a history of their travels. Characters can also travel
                through uncharted space to find more points of interest, search
                for clues, or blaze trails.
            </p>
            <h3>Some Terms</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>PC.</strong> Stands for "Player Character." Refers to
                any character played by a player.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>NPC.</strong> Stands for "Non Player Character." Refers
                to any character created by the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Creature.</strong> Refers to any living thing. This is
                important because the players will encounter all manner of life
                in the universe they create.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Deck.</strong> Refers to a collection of cards. The
                rules will call for a deck to be assembled. When this happens
                the contents of the deck will be specified.
            </p>

            <h1>Combat</h1>
            <p>
                When a PC engages an enemy in combat, they start a duel.
                Assemble a deck of two cards from each suit. The PC's player
                then draws from this deck to determine the outcome of the duel,
                based on the drawn suit. A PC may have a feature that lets them
                alter the duel deck, usually by adding a card of a certain suit.
            </p>
            <table class="hide-until-load">
                <tr>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
                All creatures can take a certain number of hits before being
                killed or knocked unconscious. For PCs, this number is usually
                2. For NPCs, the number can vary.
            </p>
            <h1>The Wayfare Engine</h1>
            <p>
                The core of Starward is the <a href="../Wayfare Engine/wayfare_engine.html">Wayfare Engine</a>, a method of drawing
                cards to create events (commonly called encounters in other
                systems) to interact with. Starward expands on the base Wayfare
                Engine with ways to incorporate your <em>Field Manuals</em> and
                other procedural elements to create diverse and rooted events.
            </p>

            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>
                To determine the kind of event encountered, assemble a full deck
                of cards (excluding the jokers), and draw one. Consult the
                following table, reading from left to right.

            <h2>Event: Advent</h2>
            <p>
                An <strong>Advent</strong> is some milestone of discovery. The
                group gains knowledge about some aspect of the world.
            </p>
            <h2>Event: Calm</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>Calm</strong> is a period where very little happens
                outside the group. This is an opportunity for players and
                characters to roleplay between themselves.
            </p>
            <h2>Event: Combat</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>Combat</strong> is some attack by an outside force.
                Enemies of the group seek to do them harm.
            </p>
            <h2>Event: Counsel</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>Counsel</strong> is a roleplay interaction with a
                faction outside of the group, usually requiring diplomacy and
                tact to resolve some issue the outside faction faces.
            </p>
            <h2>Event: Emergency</h2>
            <p>
                An <strong>Emergency</strong> is a sudden disaster that the
                group faces that will result in harm to the group.
